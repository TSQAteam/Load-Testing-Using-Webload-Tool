# Load Testing Using Webload Tool

**Introduction**

WebLOAD is easy to use and delivers maximum testing performance and value. 
WebLOAD verifies the scalability and integrity of Internet applications by generating a load composed of Virtual Clients that simulate real-world traffic. 
Probing Clients let you refine the testing process by acting as a single user that measures the performance of targeted activities, and provides individual performance statistics of the Internet application under load. 

**Load Testing Steps**

* Create an Agenda.
* Configure a Load Template using the WebLOAD Wizard.
* Configure session options. 
* Run a test.
* Analyze test results. 

**Create an Agenda**

The first step in creating an Agenda is to record your actions as you interact with your Web application.

6. Navigate through the site, performing the actions you want to test.

For example: 

	a. Enter content 'Are you sure you want to log out?' in the text field 
	b. Click 'Ginger it' button

Your actions are recorded and appear in the Agenda Tree as you navigate the site. (If you see additional nodes in the Agenda Tree with different URLs, this may be traffic generated by browser plug-ins or extensions, for example, third-party toolbars.)
