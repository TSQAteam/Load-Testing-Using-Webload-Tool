# Load Testing Using Webload Tool

Introduction:-

WebLOAD is easy to use and delivers maximum testing performance and value. 
WebLOAD verifies the scalability and integrity of Internet applications by generating a load composed of Virtual Clients that simulate real-world traffic. 
Probing Clients let you refine the testing process by acting as a single user that measures the performance of targeted activities, and provides individual performance statistics of the Internet application under load. 

Load Testing Steps:-

* Create an Agenda.
* Configure a Load Template using the WebLOAD Wizard.
* Configure session options. 
* Run a test.
* Analyze test results. 

Create an Agenda:-

The first step in creating an Agenda is to record your actions as you interact with your Web application.
